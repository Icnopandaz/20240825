# Interesting Programming Principles

Initially, I have touched upon the Zen of Python, going through each line with my thoughts on them. 

In the future, as we expand our learning I will add other interesting programming principles as well as explanations of them, in order to retain them for future and additionally ensure that I understand them, or if I don't understand them, then speculate on it and by continuing with my coding journey eventually have an answer and touch back on them.
