This code is random from https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2022/06/29/number-guessing-game-using-python/ 

I added code comments explaining the code, as a form of practice showcasing not just how simple the code is that they designed which influcences keeping it 'simple', but also to showcase my understanding via the use of code comments. Albeit, in most practical situations you wouldn't have a code comment for every single line, for research purposes however it is fine.
